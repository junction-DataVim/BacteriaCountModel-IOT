## üî¨ Overview

This API provides automated bacteria detection and counting capabilities for
microscopy images. It uses a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to identify bacteria
and return:

- Total bacteria count
- Bounding box coordinates for each detection
- Confidence scores
- Additional metadata

This API is designed to be integrated into a smart aquaculture monitoring system
that provides real-time water quality assessment through automated bacteria
detection.

## üè≠ IoT Device Process

The bacteria detection API is part of a comprehensive IoT-based water quality
monitoring system for smart aquaculture farms. Here's how the complete process
works:

### üîÑ Automated Water Quality Assessment Process

#### 1. **Water Sampling** üíß

- A robotic pump automatically collects water samples from the fish tank
- The sample is drawn into a transparent chamber within the IoT device
- Sampling occurs at regular intervals or on-demand

#### 2. **Sample Preparation** üß™

- The collected water sample is mixed with fluorescent staining agents
- Chemical reagents are automatically dispensed to highlight microbial DNA
- The mixture is allowed to settle for optimal staining

#### 3. **Fluorescent Illumination** üí°

- A glowing blue LED or UV light activates underneath the chamber
- The illumination causes stained microbial DNA to fluoresce
- Green or orange fluorescent glow indicates the presence of bacteria
- The fluorescence intensity correlates with bacterial concentration

#### 4. **Image Capture** üì∏

- A high-resolution camera captures images of the fluorescent sample
- Multiple images may be taken for better accuracy
- Images are optimized for bacterial detection algorithms

#### 5. **AI Analysis** ü§ñ

- The captured images are sent to this bacteria detection API
- Our trained YOLOv8 model processes the fluorescent bacteria images
- The AI identifies and counts individual bacteria in the sample
- Confidence scores are calculated for each detection

#### 6. **Real-time Results** üìä

- Bacteria count is instantly displayed on the device's screen
- Water quality status is determined based on bacterial load
- Warning alerts are triggered if contamination levels exceed thresholds
- Results are logged and can be transmitted to monitoring systems

### üö® Alert System

The system provides immediate feedback:

- **üü¢ Clean Water**: Low bacterial count, safe for aquaculture
- **üü° Monitor**: Moderate levels, requires attention
- **üî¥ Contaminated Water Detected**: High bacterial load, immediate action
  required

### üì° Integration Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous water quality assessment
- **Remote Access**: API endpoints allow remote monitoring
- **Data Logging**: Historical bacteria count data for trend analysis
- **Automated Alerts**: Instant notifications when contamination is detected
